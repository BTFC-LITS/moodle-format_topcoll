/**
 * Collapsed Topics Information
 *
 * A topic based format that solves the issue of the 'Scroll of Death' when a course has many topics. All topics
 * except zero have a toggle that displays that topic. One or more topics can be displayed at any given time.
 * Toggles are persistent on a per browser session per course basis but can be made to persist longer by a small
 * code change. Full installation instructions, code adaptions and credits are included in the 'Readme.txt' file.
 *
 * @package    course/format
 * @subpackage topcoll
 * @version    See the value of '$plugin->version' in version.php.
 * @copyright  (c) 2009-onwards G J Barnard in respect to modifications of standard topics format.

<p>If you choose 'Allowed' you agree that the next time you click on a toggle in any 'Collapsed Topics' based course then the 'mdl_cf_topcoll' cookie will be placed on your computer for the duration of the browser session or longer if you administrator has allowed - they can determine for how long.  It will remember the state of the toggles when you click on them.  If you choose 'Denied' the cookie will not be placed on your computer.  Once chosen this will be remembered for all 'Collapsed Topics' based courses and you will not be asked again unless your administrator performs a reset - please refer to 'Cookie Consent Information' in the 'Readme.txt' file of the format.</p>
